# Getting Started with Adobe I/O Runtime

If you&rsquo;ve read the [introductory documentation](overview/what_is_runtime.md), then you&rsquo;re already familiar with the Runtime concept: an easy way to run code on demand on Adobe's Cloud Platform and integrate with Adobe&rsquo;s cloud services without the effort of managing servers and the expense of always-on computing resources.  

Runtime is currently in beta, and if you're an existing Adobe Enterprise customer, you can contact your account representatives to get access. If you have access to Runtime, you can log into the Adobe I/O Console, create a new integration, and then set up a namespace for yourself. All actions you run on Runtime are executed within a namespace associated with an integration. Once you have the namespace created, you'll get an authorization key that you can use to create and manage your actions.

Once you have an authorization key and an integration with a namespace created, you&rsquo;ll need to install the OpenWhisk CLI. Then, you can get started building applications on the system:

* [Deploy and invoke your first action](quickstarts/deploy.md)
* [Debug your actions](quickstarts/debug.md)
